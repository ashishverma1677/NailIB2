  <h1>Why Us</h1>
  <p>
    We are a dedicated group of professionals who have designed Nail IB to accelerate the learning speed of our students. We not only provide with the curricular notes but also provide with useful advice to ensure that the decisions you take while choosing your IB subjects will not unduly limit the opportunities waiting for you. We use a multi- scale approach for the students to understand the details of every topic. We seek to bridge the gap between a smart and a dull student as we believe that every student if taught well under proper guidance will score a decent grade which will get him in his desired university. We lead collaborative teams specialised in their subjects to engage the students in practically knowing the subject. There is no other platform like Nail IB for the students because we promote intercultural understanding and encourage students to become active in exploring their subject of interest. We aim to teach the children to explore what is to learn, ask challenging and thoughtful questions. We set a long- term vision for the students that will inspire them to score better grades. We have regular, ongoing and rigorous training going on. We also maintain high- quality, consistent academic standards. We focus majorly on curriculum and how well the student can understand it. And therefore, we try building easy content for every subject. We encourage a positive attitude to learning by challenging students to solve problems, show creativity and resourcefulness and participate actively in their communities. We not only understand our students but also understand their parents and therefore we maintain transparency in the education provided to the students so that even the parents are aware and satisfied about the learning their kids do with us. 
  </p>
    <div class="AkshatPhoto"></div>
  <p>
    We are an educational institute offering full programs and individual courses online. We provide with lessons and study sessions when the students are on the go. So the students should not worry even if there’s a budget set because we provide with top quality education content at a very cost effective price. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We teach the rules of the subjects and then we show how well the students can master it than anyone else. We are a group of diligent and experienced educators who are completely dedicated to our task, that is creating global students. 
  </p>
  <p>
   At Nail IB we get the students involved in the process of learning by presenting complicated concepts in a simple and understandable manner. We also ensure complete grasp of the theories and their application. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We also provide with the feedback section which will help us improve in the long run and more than that it will help us understand our customer’s needs and demands. We promise you will never fall back and will always have our back and the IB motivation on the go. We want all our students to be pro- active rather than a re- active. All formats and templates  are provided on the website. You can also connect to the IB teachers from all over the world. We will be more like a best friend who understands your problem and together help you come out of it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope to have you learn and grow with us!
